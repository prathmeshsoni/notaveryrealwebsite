# Not a Very Real Website (navrw.mrsoni.in)

Welcome to **Not a Very Real Website** — the internet's fakest open hosting project!

## What is this?
A tiny, tongue-in-cheek static site where anyone can add their own HTML page (like `/yourname`) and pretend to be part of a fake internet community. No backend, no surveillance, no captchas — just HTML and vibes.

## Live Site
[https://navrw.mrsoni.in](https://navrw.mrsoni.in)

## How it works
- The root `index.html` is the homepage, explaining the project and linking to the GitHub repo.
- Each subfolder (like `yourname/`) contains an `index.html` for a personal or fun page.
- The site is static and can be hosted on GitHub Pages or any static host.

## Add your own page
1. **Fork** this repo on GitHub: [prathmesh-hexon/notaveryrealwebsite](https://github.com/prathmesh-hexon/notaveryrealwebsite)
2. **Create a folder** with your name (or any fun alias):
   ```
   cd notaveryrealwebsite/Sites && mkdir yourname
   ```
3. **Add an `index.html`** inside your folder. You can copy the sample from `yourname/index.html`.
4. **Commit and push** your changes.
5. **Open a Pull Request** to get your page added to the site!

## Example
```
notaveryrealwebsite/
├── Sites/
│   └── yourname/              # Your folder
│       └── index.html         # Your personal page
```

## Why?
Because the internet needs more weird, fun, and pointless things.
